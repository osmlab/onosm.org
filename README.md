# OnOSM

An easy way to get a business on to OpenStreetMap.

## Description

OnOSM helps business owners provide structured data about their shop. The result is written to an anonymous [Note](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes) that is placed on the map. To see examples previously created notes,  take a look at [recently created notes](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/?query=submitted%20note%20from%20a%20business) using NoteReview, another community developed application.

## Available languages

Application defaults to displaying text in British English. Alternate translations are also available. They can be selected at anytime using the drop-down at the top of the page.
