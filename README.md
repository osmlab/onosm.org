 * Site specific css lives in ```css/site.css``` for positioning of specific elements
 * Global style changes live in ```css/style.css```
 * Translations live in ```locales``` and are more than welcome!
 * Prefer 4 space soft tab in javascript
 * For UI changes, don't forget to include a screenshot or two in the pull request
